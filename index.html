		<ul>
			<li>I come from Hangzhou, a <span class="scenic">scenic</span> city in <span class="china">China</span></li>
			<li>Then go to San Diego for my college</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>I am <del> undeclared, but trying to</del> major in Computer Science <del>by taking necessary courses and maintaining a GPA high enough for me to get accepted</del></li>
			<li>By myself, I have studied programming languages including <span class="program" tip="I'm the best language in the world!">C++</span>, <span class="program" tip="This is his first programming language">Java</span>, <span class="program" tip="Without me he cannot finish this website XD">JavaScript (JQuery, HTML, CSS)</span>, <span class="program" tip="He used me to web crawled a lot of info that he does't want you to know">Python</span> and <span class="program" tip="No he had classes in high school, but basic ones"><del>VB</del></span></li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>This is my fourth year since I started enjoying the mystery and magnificence of computer science, so I was pretty disappointed in the first year of my college, </li>
			<li>- not only because of the contents of the classes, but also because of the lack of possibilities for first-year international students</li>
			<li>However, there is still much to learn both right now and in the near future</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Under this GitHub page, I have hosted a tool for keeping a journal for me <span class="secret">Yes I wrote more than a quarter of a million words in two hundered hours each year</span></li>
