				<p>I'm Runjie Guan, a second-year student in UC San Diego. People nowadays don't like read long paragraphs, so I'll keep my introduction as short as possible.</p>
				<p>Online social media has shaped us in a way that we want to grab as much as possible information in a period of time as short as possible. We read, but shallowly. We write, but shortly. We listen, but unconsciosly. We think, but superficially. </p>
				<p>
					But that's not the reason I love simplicity. It's a principle that I stick to promote efficiency and clarity. In Computer Science, they call it <i>performance</i>.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>My first program was written about seven years ago, in my middle school. But I was not interested in this then. Several years later in 2011, as a high-school student I started to learn Java using a book in which most of the examples wouldn't even compile. I was a kiddo then, knowing nothing about the importance of a good textbook, but I still managed to finish my first Java Applet, by which I helped myself memorizing English words.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately I lost its source code, which had anything that I needed to learn in my first programming course in my college. </p>
				<p>
					After that my journey with code began. I love to code out of pure interest, and thus love everything programmable and customizable. Because of that, I <a href="#project">write code</a> to make myself easier and happier, and hopefully benefit others.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Besides that I also play other stuffs. I play Rubik's cube (personal best 21.39', speed cubing), billiards. I play Minecraft (because it is highly programmable and creative) and FPS video games like Call of Duty. I play <a href="https://www.ingress.com" target="_blank">Ingress</a>, as the second player to reach highest level here in San Diego.

					<p>In this console-based puzzle game, you act as a programmer who is about to quit his job.</p>
					<p>However, just before the player does that, he received a letter from someone mysterious. Following what the mysterious man says for some reason, he starts to discover something strange and exciting about his company as well as his company's competitor. And a conspiracy emerges ...</p>

					<p>People don't write stuffs these days, but I keep what is going on in my life weekly, if not daily.</p>
					<p>Demand determines supply and quality - this is how I understand today's Internet market. Among all the friends I've met in my life, nobody regularly writes down what they have experienced, not to mention the quantity of good apps that help you do that. There are, of course, those with either limited features or limited platform support. </p>
					<p>Then I decide to create one on my own, whose core part took me three months to write, with 30K lines of HTML/CSS/JavaScript. This webapp will store the data on user's OneDrive account, and can read uploaded pictures and videos from their phones. </p>
					<p>
						Since there seems to be only me using this stuff, I've made it to be highly personalized for my own life pattern. And because OneDrive <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29425390/onedrive-oauth-token-request-gets-cors-error" target="_blank">does not include</a> CORS support for <a href="https://dev.onedrive.com/auth/msa_oauth.htm#code-flow" target="_blank">code flow</a> in its authenticating steps, I have to install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog" target="_blank">a Chrome extension</a> to fix this problem.
